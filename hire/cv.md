## Summary
Straight to the point, right? I'm a (web) software engineer, who spent the last 4 years architecting complex information systems at scale, developing lots of tools and features, mentoring old colleagues, interviewing new ones and learning tons about [how the internet works](/hire/how-the-internet-works.gif).

Programming is my biggest passion (though not the only one) at the moment and I'm kinda on a mission of getting to the top in software engineering.

I have decent front-end skills with the vanilla browser stack and React. I feel very confident writing Javascript, Golang, Bash or PHP on the back end, but will be happy to learn whatever fits my team the best. I'm also very DevOps-spirited and love automating internal processes as much as possible. And I'm a [heavy user of containers](/hire/docker-all-the-things.png).

I'm a technology agnostic and always look for the best tool for the job. Have no emotional bonds to programming languages (though Golang rocks!).

Oh, and I care a lot about what I do.
