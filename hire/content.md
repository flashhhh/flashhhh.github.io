## Summary
I'm a web software engineer, who spent the last 4 years architecting complex information systems at scale, developing lots of tools and features, mentoring old colleagues, interviewing new, and learning tons about [how the internet works](/hire/how-the-internet-works.gif).

Programming is my biggest passion (though not the only one) at the moment and I'm kind of on a mission of getting to the top in software engineering.

I feel very confident writing Javascript, Golang, Bash or PHP on the back end and I'm always happy to learn whatever fits my team the best. I'm also very DevOps-spirited and love automating internal processes as much as possible. And I'm a [heavy user of containers](/hire/docker-all-the-things.png). I have solid front-end skills with the vanilla browser stack and React.

I'm a technology agnostic and always look for the best tool for the job. And I care a lot about what I do.

Some of the soft skills I developed over time.
- Always strive to see the big picture and act in the best interest of the business.
- Put eliminating technical debt the top priority.
- Got the "treat people how you want to be treated" attitude.
- Value simplicity the most.
- Constantly trying to add some organizational and cultural value.
